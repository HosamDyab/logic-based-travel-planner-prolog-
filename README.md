## 🧩 Problem Definition

Before **logic-based systems** like *Prolog*, travel planning was a daunting task. Travelers struggled with **trustworthy recommendations**, **accurate budgeting**, and accessing **destination details** (e.g., landmarks, cultural sites). Upon arrival, challenges like selecting **budget-friendly hotels**, arranging **transportation**, and planning **activities** (e.g., shopping, cinema, museum tours) added complexity. The **Logic-based Travel Planner** addresses these pain points with an **automated**, *intelligent framework* that optimizes decision-making and enhances the travel experience.

## 📝 Project Description

### Introduction

The **Logic-based Travel Planner** redefines travel planning with **customized itineraries** powered by **Prolog**. Designed for the *Logic Programming Course*, it calculates **budgets**, recommends **hotels**, and provides **destination insights**, all while ensuring a *seamless* user experience. Future iterations will introduce a **GUI** and **real-time data integration**, aligning with modern travel tech trends.

### Technical Approach

A **rule-based expert system** built with **Prolog**, this project tackles the *complexity* of travel planning with precision and scalability.

#### System Components

- **Knowledge Base**:  
  - `city/1`: e.g., `cairo`, `aswan`.  
  - `attraction/2`: e.g., `attraction(cairo, pyramids)`.  
  - `hotel/4`: e.g., `hotel(cairo, 'four_seasons', 2000, 4.8)`.  
  - `transport/3`: e.g., `transport(cairo, car, 500)`.  
  - `activity/3`: e.g., `activity(cairo, shopping, 300)`.  
  - *Scalable* with modular design for future enhancements (e.g., user reviews).

- **Inference Engine**:  
  - Uses **Prolog’s unification** and *backtracking* for efficient rule execution.

- **Interface Layer**:  
  - Current **CLI**; future **GUI** planned.

#### Technical Features

1. **Budget Estimation**: Aggregates costs (hotel, transport, food, activities).  
   - Example: `2000 * 3 + 500 + (300 * 3) = 6800 EGP` for a 3-day Cairo trip.
2. **Hotel Recommendations**: Filters `hotel/4` by budget and `Rating` (e.g., ≥ 4.2).
3. **Destination Information**: Queries `attraction/2` for landmarks and cultural sites.
4. **Transportation Assistance**: Matches `transport/3` to cities with cost optimization.
5. **Personalized Recommendations**: Uses `personalized_recommendation/4` for tailored plans.
6. **Activity Discovery**: Maps `activity/3` to user interests.

#### Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Independent facts and rules for easy updates.
- **Efficiency**: *Polynomial-time* performance via Prolog backtracking.
- **Scalability**: Ready for *real-time data* and *multi-user support*.
- **Reliability**: Robust input validation and constraint checking.
